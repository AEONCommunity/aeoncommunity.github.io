<h1>How To Contribute to the AEON Project</h1>

<p>AEON is an open source project, and therefore it's life comes from the <b>AEON community</b>; the regular people who decide to follow the project.</p>

<p>An open source project has a much better chance of surviving long-term if it's community is <b>active</b> in the project. Here are some ways you can get involved and contribute to the success of AEON.</p> 

<h2>Follow the Community Discussions</h2>
<p>Possibly the most important first step to getting involved is to simply get informed on what is going on in the AEON world. The various community discussions provide this touchpoint, and by engaging here, you will learn a lot about how to contribute further. We need more people discussing AEON, and giving their opinions and ideas for the project.  Progress will accelerate with increased discussion participation. Here are some of the important discussion locations.</p>

<h3>Core Blockchain Discussions</h3>
<p>The first place to keep up with core blockchain topics is on the <a href="https://github.com/aeonix/aeon">aeon github project</a>. The AEON developer team watches the issue discussions and enhancement proposals closely on github, and when there is a lot of community feedback here, it lets the Devs know which issues are important. You can click on the <b>Issues</b> tab or the <b>Pull requests</b> tab to find topics of discussion.</p>
<p>Another place that the Devs hang out regularly is the AEON IRC channel. The IRC channel is a fine place to ask questions and get help as well. If you do not have an IRC client, you can navigate to <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/">webchat.freenode.net</a> and register a nickname to join the <b>#aeon</b> channel. There is also a bridge that allows you to easily read the IRC chats from within the Discord community (see below).</p>

<h3>Community Discussions</h3>
<p>There are several places which are more focused on general community discussions. These are places where you can ask questions, propose ideas, and get help with using AEON.</p> 

*   the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/">AEON sub-reddit</a> is a place for the community to post and comment about AEON. It also has a great set of useful AEON-related links in the sidebar.
*   the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/TM8mEsx">AEON Discord community</a> is a great place to hang out, which has severl topic lobbies. Topics range from <b>mining</b> to <b>crypto-news</b> to <b>publications</b> and <b>marketing</b>. There are also lobbies which act as a bridge to the aeon sub-reddit and the IRC channel.

<h2>Keep Up With the AEON Funding System</h2>
<p>Using <a href="https://aeonfunding.com/">AEON's funding system</a>, anyone can propose projects that would need some time and effort to complete. Note that a project can be something other than coding a new application. A minimum amount of required funding can be stated. The community can donate to the fund, and when the amount is reached, the project is considered "fully funded." Whoever completes the work will receive the funds. This is a great place to suggest project ideas, or for community members to find projects to work on.</p>

<h2>Run a Full Node</h2>
<p>Instead of running your wallet using a remote node, you can run your own node (aeond) on your own computer.  Once you have aeond set up, then you can let it run with port 11180 open. This will not only give you maximum privacy with your transactions, it will also allow your node to participate in distributing the blockchain to new users.</p>

<h2>Mine For AEON</h2>
<p>The more miners on the network, the more decentralized and secure the network remains. You can easily start mining with the <b>start_mining</b> command in the aeond application or the aeon-wallet-cli application. (<b>NOTE:</b> This method of mining will not likely succeed in acquiring any AEON coins, but will still contribute to network decentralization. To successfully mine AEON coins, you will most likely use a separate mining application with an online mining pool.)</p>

<h2>Run A Public Node</h2>
<p>Even better than running a full node on your local machine, you can use a virtual machine on the internet to run a full node, and allow others to connect their wallets to your node.  The more public nodes on the network, the more decentralized the network will remain. Users who cannot run a full node locally need a good selection of available public nodes to choose from.  For information on how to set up a public node <b>for free</b> on the AWS Cloud, <a href="https://medium.com/@AEON_Community/setting-up-an-amazon-aws-aeon-public-node-on-a-free-ec2-instance-b6952a598cdc">read this How-To</a>.</p>

<h2>Be an AEON Content Creator</h2>
<p>It has been said that "content is king" on the internet, and there is validity in the statement. For people who are new to crypto currencies and AEON, there is a need for information which is readily available and easy to understand.</p> 
<p>A number of "How-To" guides have already been written by community members, but more is better. If you learn how to do something and there is not already a guide for that, please write one! If you aren't sure where to post it, ask the community, and someone will find a spot for your content to live online.</p>
<p>If you are able to document general information about AEON and how it fits into the world of blockchains and crypto currencies, feel free to create that content, and then ask where it should live.  And lastly, if you find any existing content that is wrong or out of date, please inform the content owner or the community, so it can be updated. (If the content source is available on github, feel free to update things yourself, and submit a pull-request to that repository.)</p>

<h2>Develop/Test/Propose AEON Apps and Utilities</h2>
<p>Beyond the core blockchain and wallet applications, there are many other useful apps that can be build to further the AEON project. If programming in C++ is not your thing, but you can program in another language, you can lend your talents to other coding projects.</p>
<p>Examples of projects that have been done by the community are:</p>

*   The <a href="https://aeonfunding.com">AEON Funding System</a>
*   The <a href="https://aeonfunding.com">AEON API</a> site allows you to pay Bitcoin With AEON
*   The <a href="https://betaeon.win">AEON Gambling site</a> allows you to bet AEON on the next block hash numbers
  
<p>If you are not a coder, but have an idea for a useful app, you can suggest it to the community and even submit a proposal for funding over at the <a href="https://aeonfunding.com">AEON Funding System</a>.</p>

<h2>Develop And/Or Test the Core AEON Source Code</h2>
<p>The AEON core blockchain and wallet apps are primarily written in C++.  If that is your language, feel free to peruse the source code, and offer to make any changes or fixes you think would be valuable. Pull requests are merged based on community consensus and core developer review. (<b>NOTE:</b> Currently AEON has a small team of core developers with expert ability and knowledge of the code. Without a solid background in this type of programming, it is unlikely that a person would make significant contributions to the project in this area.)</p>

<h2>Spread The Word In Your Circles</h2>
<p>For AEON to someday become a digital currency used by the masses, the word needs to spread to the masses that AEON exists as a solid option for a private, secure, and reliable digital currency. If you are reading this, you probably already know more about crypto currencies and AEON than most of your friends and family. Look for opportunities to introduce those you know to the concepts in general, and to AEON specifically.  Offer to help them get their feet wet in the digital currency world, by trying AEON first.  This is a fantastic way to contribute to the AEON project.</p>
