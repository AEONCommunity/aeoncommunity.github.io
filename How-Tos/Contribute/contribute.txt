<h1>How To Contribute to the AEON Project</h1>

<p>AEON is an open source project, and therefore it lives and dies by the actions of the <b>AEON community</b>; the regular people who decide to follow the project.</p>

<p>An open source project has a much better chance of surviving long-term if it's community is <b>active</b> in the project. Here are some ways you can get involved and contribute to the success of AEON.</p> 

<h2>Run a Full Node</h2>
<p>Instead of running your wallet using a remote node, you can run your own node (aeond) on your own computer.  Once you have aeond set up, then you can let it run with port 11180 open. This will not only give you maximum privacy with your transactions, it will also allow your node to participate in distributing the blockchain to new users.</p>

<h2>Mine For AEON</h2>
<p>The more miners on the network, the more decentralized and secure the network remains. You can easily start mining with the <b>start_mining</b> command in the aeond application or the aeon-wallet-cli application. (<b>NOTE:</b> This method of mining will not likely succeed in acquiring any AEON coins, but will still contribute to network decentralization. To successfully mine AEON coins, you will want to use an online mining pool or set up a local mining pool with multiple machines.)</p>

<h2>Run A Public Node</h2>
<p>Even better than running a full node on your local machine, you can use a virtual machine on the internet to run a full node, and allow others to connect their wallets to your node.  The more public nodes on the network, the more decentralized the network will remain. Users who cannot run a full node locally need a good selection of available public nodes to choose from.  For information on how to set up a public node <b>for free</b> on the AWS Cloud, read this How-To.</p>

<h2>Develop And/Or Test the Core AEON Source Code</h2>
The AEON core blockchain and wallet apps are primarily written in C++.  If that is your language, feel free to peruse the source code, and offer to make any changes or fixes you think would be valuable. Pull requests are merged based on community consensus and core developer review. (<b>NOTE:</b> Currently AEON has a small team of core developers with expert ability and knowledge of the code. Without a solid background in this type of programming, it is unlikely that a person would make significant contributions to the project in this area.)</p>

<h2>Develop And/Or Test Other AEON Apps and Utilities</h2>

<h2>Keep Up With the AEON Funding System</h2>
<p>AEON utilizes a funding system where anyone can propose projects that would need some time and effort to complete (code development or otherwise). A minimum amount of required funding can be stated. The community can donate to the fund, and when the minimum amount is reached, the project is considered "fully funded." Whoever completes the work will receive the funds. This is a great place to suggest project ideas, or for developers to find projects to work on.</p>

<h2>Participate in Community Discussions</h2>
<p>Possibly the most important place to keep up with discussions in on github. The AEON developer team watches the issue discussions and enhancement proposals closely on github, and when there is a lot of community feedback here, it lets the Devs know which issues are important.  The github AEON project is here.  You can click on "???" or "???" to find topics of discussion.</p>
<p>Another place that the Devs hang out regularly is the AEON IRC channel. By keeping up here, you can learn a lot about what is going on with the core development. If you do not use an IRC client, there is a bridge that allows you to easily read the IRC chats from within the Discord community (see below).
<p>The other important places for weighing in on all-things-AEON are the AEON sub-reddit, and the AEON Discord community. Anyone can join in with comments and posts, and if you keep up with the conversations, you will hear about ideas that you can help with. We need more people interested in the topics, and giving their opinions and ideas for AEON.  Progress will accelerate with increased discussion participation.</p>
