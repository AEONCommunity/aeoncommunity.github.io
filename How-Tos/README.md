This folder contains all the How-To articles hosted by this github pages project.

Each subfolder contains all the contents for a single How-To. Typically, there will be a single ".md" file with all the text, and several image files linked to from within the ".md" file.  The markdown should follow the expected github pages mark down / html style.  When finished, the how-to's ".md" file is linked to from the **index.md** file in the main project folder.
