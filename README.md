# aeon-coin-info
This site is a collection point for various information about AEON. It hosts some how-to's for AEON coin, and also links to how-to's that are hosted in other places.

## Vision for This Site
Going forward, the site may grow to host or link to other kinds of useful AEON information, as it makes sense.

The intent is to have a site that is easy to navigate, which collects information in one place for the AEON Community.  If in the future the Community establishes a hosted site for this purpose (similar to www.monero.how for example), then the information on this site will most logically be moved to that future site.  Until then, I am happy to maintain this github pages repo for this purpose.

## Repository Layout
In the main project directory:

*   **index.md** is the home page content.
*   **config.yml** sets the jekyll theme configuration.
*   **README.md** is this content which you are reading.
*   **assets/** holds images and css style modifications for the aeon-coin-info web pages.
*   **How-Tos/** is a folder that holds any How-Tos which are hosted in this github project.
*   **information/** is a folder to upload other information (nothing links to this yet).

## Contributing Here
Contributions are encouraged! If you see something obvious that needs corrected, feel free to open an issue, or make a Pull Request.  If you have an idea for a better layout/theme/organizational structure, please open an issue for discussion first. 

If you want to write a How-To, and get it hosted here, use the content in the **How-Tos** folder as examples. Each How-Tos sub-folder contains all of the content for a single how-to article. There is typically 1 ".md" file for the text, and multiple image files.  The ".md" file is the expected github pages markdown/html format.  Once the how-to is ready, add a link to it from the main **index.md** file, and do a Pull Request.

If I don't respond here on github right away, I am fairly active over on the AEON Discord community, and there is a **publications** topic there which I watch.
