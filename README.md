# AEONCommunity Pages
[This github pages site](https://AEONCommunity.github.io/) belongs to the AEON Community. It hosts or links to various information about the AEON digital currency.

## Vision for This Site

The intent is to have a site that is easy to navigate, which collects information in one place for the AEON Community. 

## Site Repository Structure 

In the main project directory:

*   **index.md** is the home page content.
*   **config.yml** sets the jekyll theme configuration.
*   **README.md** is this content which you are reading.
*   **assets/** holds images and css style modifications for the aeon-coin-info web pages.
*   **_includes/** holds the markdown for each main section of content on the front page; one .md file per section.
*   **How-Tos/** is a folder that holds any How-Tos which are hosted in this github project.
*   **information/** is a folder to upload other information (nothing links to this yet).

## Contributing Here
Contributions are encouraged! 

*   **Suggestions/Additions:** Feel free to open an issue to report any errors, or to make suggestions, or to propose adding new content.
*   **Link to a How-To:** If you want an AEON how-to linked from here, open an issue and someone will review and add it.
*   **Hosting a How-To:** If you want to write a How-To and host it here, use the content in the **How-Tos** folder as examples. Create a branch and add a new How-To sub-folder. When the how-to is ready, add a link to it from the appropriate **.md** file in the **_includes** folder, and do a Pull Request.

If there is not a timely response here on github, surf over to the AEON Discord community, and comment in the **publications** channel.
